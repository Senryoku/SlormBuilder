# SlormBuilder

Outdated character builder for Slormancer.

[Accessible Here](https://senryoku.github.io/SlormBuilder/)

## Game Assets

This project uses game assets from The Slormancer by [Slormite Studios](https://www.slormitestudios.com). These assets have been used with explicit permission from the developers for this application.

## TODO

- Ancestral Tree
  - Fix skills positions
  - Display 'selected' background
  - Display 'trail'?
- Gear
  - Fix icons size and positions
- Skills
  - Remove "duplicated code" for description parsing.
  -	Next Rank/Max Rank
  - Fix 'mechanics' reminder: IIRC keywords in skill descriptions used to be surrounded with <>, it's not the case anymore. I don't know how to map kills to relevant mechanics.
